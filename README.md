# SimpleChatSoftware
A simple chat program implemented by socket communication
The "client" directory contains client code which builds a Android App for sending and receive message.
The "server" directory contains server code which implements a server for acting as a bridge among with clients to communicate.

## operation step
1. start the client app
2. click a menu whose icon's shape is like a  cloud on the actionbar.
3. a dialog show and you need to input the right ip/area name and the port that are configured in the server.
4. then click the "sure" button for ending configuration, and waiting for connect the server.
6. if the connection is ok, you can send a text message to server and receive that from server.

### That's a first edition. The chat message is only limited on text and the App's UI is so simple(may be a little ugly). So I will enrich its functions for example chat message can support picture and audio media file. The beautility about chat interface will be taken into consideration as well in the future. That's all and make you happy.
